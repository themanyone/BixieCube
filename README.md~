#RubyCubie

A simple remake of the classic 3x3x3 Rubik's cube puzzle game with 2x2x2, 5x5x5, and now up to 9x9x9 cubes, selectable.

##Installation. 

No instillation required. It runs in the browser using [threejs](https://threejs.org/).

##Running 

* When a face key, any of "abcdef", is pressed, that face is rotated clockwise (e.g. 'a'). If shifted (or 'A') for example, it rotates the face counter-clockwise.

* When a number key 2-9 is pressed, it determines how many layers should be rotated for the next face turn (e.g. '2a').

* Once the rotation finishes, we reset layers to 1, so you don't have to keep typing '1a', '1b', etc. Just type the lettr to rotate a sigle face.

##Configuration

* Click the gear icon to change the number of Cubies per axis.
