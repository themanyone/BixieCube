#RubyCubie by themanyone

Redesigning the classic 3x3x3 Rubik's cube puzzle game. And also 5x5x5 (and up to 20x20x20 cubes, select-able) in 3D.


When a face key, any of "abcdef", is pressed, that face is rotated clockwise (e.g. 'a'). If shifted (or 'A') for example, it rotates the face counter-clockwise.

When a number key 2-9 is pressed, it determines how many layers should be rotated for the next face turn (e.g. '2a').

Once the rotation finishes, we reset layers to 1, so you don't have to keep typing '1a', '1b', etc. Just type the lettr to rotate a sigle face.
