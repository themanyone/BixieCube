#BixieCube

A remake of the classic 3x3x3 [Rubik's Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube) puzzle game. Now with 2x2x2, 5x5x5, and now up to 9x9x9 cubes, selectable (more in code).

##Installation

No instillation required. It runs in the browser.

##Contributing

Source code is available from https://github.com/themanyone/BixieCube

TL-DR. This package depends on [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) being available. After playing the game, it will be stored in the browser cache. If desired for web hosting or whatever, you may also install it separately.

##Running

* Touch (click) & drag faces to turn them.

* Drop images on cube faces and background to change textures and wallpaper.

* Customize by clicking on the gear icon.

###Keyboard shortcuts

* "abcdef": rotate faces clockwise. (Shift to rotate counter-clockwise).

* Number keys 1-9 determine how many layers should be rotated at a time.

##Configuration

* Click the gear icon to change the number of Cubies per axis.
